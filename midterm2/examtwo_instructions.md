Exam 2, EC602 Fall 2022
=======================


Instructions
------------

There are two options for this exam. Choose one only.

---------------------------------------------

Option One:
------------

Create a program to input and process the results of World Cup group stage games.

The input should be the results of games with enough detail to allow for determining
which two teams move on to the knockout round.

The output should be a table of the teams and the results.
with columns such as Points, Goal Differential, and so forth.

You may use the sort function provided by <algorithm>

As an additional challenge, you can handle games from multiple groups, or just 
process a single groups' games.

---------------------------------------------

Option Two:
-----------

If you know nothing about soccer/football/The World Cup, you can do this equivalent
program instead.

Create a program to input and process the results of a sporting event or competition.
It could be a chess tournament, a swim meet, a singing competition, etc. 
The key is that there should be multiple competitors and multiple competitions to report.

The input should be the results of games with enough detail to allow for determining
the status of the competition when it is completed.

The output should be a table of the competitors and the results.
with columns such as Wins, Points, etc, whatever is relevant for this event.

You may use the sort function provided by <algorithm>

---------------------------------------------


Evaluation:
-----------
Your program will be evaluated on the following 

- the program should have an explanation of the input and output formats. This
  can be done in comments, or with explanatory text outputs by the code.

- the program should compile and run as described

- the data structures used to store the competition data will be evaluated for 
  appropriateness, readability, effectiveness.

- code structure quality: effective use of functions, classes

- readability: effective use of comments, variable names. 

- the sort feature is secondary. More important to have well designed data structures,
  nice input/output formats, and easy to read code.

- basic error checking should be implemented. For example, the names of the competitors
should make sense (e.g. 4 teams in a group for the World Cup option)

Submitting:
---------

Submit one C++ file with all code and documentation, with the authors identified
using the Copyright line(s).

The submit link is: https://curl.bu.edu:9999/ec602/fall2022/submit_assignment/examtwo

and the program should be called examtwo.cpp
